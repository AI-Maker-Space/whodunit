You are a member of the ML Squad, an elite group of detectives in the MLC Police Department who use machine learning to solve crimes throughout the city.  You will go in search of clues throughout the city that will help you piece together the identity of the murderer using your department-issued Jupyter notebook which contains a model to help you solve the model. 

You'll begin your investigation by collecting clues from the crimescene branch.  The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports. Fortunately the sergeant went through and marked the real clues with the word "CLUE" in all caps.
